# üìö PROJECT MEMORY - MAIN FILE
**Current Version: v1.0.0**  
**Last Updated: September 11, 2025**

## üîÑ VERSION HISTORY
- **v1.0.0** - Initial WebRTC Implementation (Sept 11, 2025)

---

## üì± CURRENT STATE: WebRTC Voice Calling Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer audio streaming
- **Firebase Firestore**: For signaling and call state management  
- **Metered.ca**: For TURN/STUN servers
- **Flutter WebRTC Plugin**: flutter_webrtc package

### Working Features ‚úÖ
1. **Voice Calls**: One-to-one audio calls working
2. **Call Flow**: Outgoing ‚Üí WebRTCCallScreen, Incoming ‚Üí Overlay ‚Üí WebRTCCallScreen
3. **Profile Display**: Users see OTHER person's profile (FIXED)
4. **Timer Sync**: Server timestamp based timing
5. **Connection Quality**: Real-time monitoring with visual indicators
6. **Network Recovery**: Auto-reconnection on network changes
7. **Audio Controls**: Mute/Speaker toggle working
8. **Call Termination**: Both users disconnect properly

### Key Files
- `lib/services/webrtc_call_service.dart` - Main WebRTC service
- `lib/screens/webrtc_call_screen.dart` - Call UI screen
- `lib/services/simple_call_service.dart` - Call orchestration
- `lib/services/global_call_handler.dart` - Incoming call handling
- `lib/widgets/webrtc_incoming_call_overlay.dart` - Incoming call UI

### Fixed Issues History
1. ‚úÖ Profile display bug (users were seeing own profile)
2. ‚úÖ Audio configuration conflicts  
3. ‚úÖ Connection failures behind NAT
4. ‚úÖ Signaling state conflicts
5. ‚úÖ Timer synchronization
6. ‚úÖ Call termination sync

### API Keys & Configuration
- **Metered.ca API**: Configured in webrtc_call_service.dart
- **Firebase**: Configured in google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist
- **TURN/STUN**: Dynamic credentials from Metered.ca

### Build Commands
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Outgoing call initiates correctly
- [ ] Incoming call shows overlay
- [ ] Accept/Reject buttons work
- [ ] Audio flows both directions
- [ ] Timer shows same duration for both users
- [ ] Mute/unmute works
- [ ] Speaker toggle works
- [ ] Call ends for both users
- [ ] 45-second timeout works
- [ ] Busy detection works

## üö´ CRITICAL RULES (NEVER BREAK)

1. **ALWAYS READ FIRST, ACT SECOND**
   - Read ALL relevant files completely
   - Understand CURRENT implementation
   - Check what's ALREADY WORKING
   - NEVER assume - always verify

2. **NEVER DELETE WITHOUT PERMISSION**
   - Don't delete working features
   - Don't replace existing implementations
   - Only ADD or FIX, never REMOVE unless told

3. **FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY**
   - If told to "read and fix" - READ FIRST
   - Do EXACTLY what's asked, nothing more

4. **VERIFY BEFORE MODIFYING**
   - Test current functionality first
   - Only fix REAL issues

5. **PRESERVE EXISTING WORK**
   - Respect code that's already there
   - Keep working features intact

## üìù NOTES & DECISIONS

### Why WebRTC Instead of ZEGOCLOUD?
- Better control over connection
- No dependency on third-party SDK
- More reliable for web platform
- Cost-effective (using Metered.ca for TURN)

### Call State Flow
1. **Initiating**: Create Firestore doc ‚Üí Navigate to WebRTCCallScreen
2. **Receiving**: Listen for calls ‚Üí Show overlay ‚Üí Accept/Reject
3. **Connected**: WebRTC peer connection established
4. **Ended**: Clean up resources ‚Üí Navigate back

### Known Limitations
- No video calling (audio only)
- No group calls (one-to-one only)
- No call recording
- No CallKit integration (iOS)

---

## üîÆ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Not Implemented)
1. Video calling support
2. Group calls with SFU
3. Call recording
4. CallKit/ConnectionService integration
5. Call history
6. Missed call notifications
7. Background mode support

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT CHANGE
- Profile display logic (working correctly)
- Timer synchronization (using server timestamp)
- Call termination flow (both users disconnect)
- TURN/STUN configuration (Metered.ca)
- Audio configuration (AndroidAudioConfiguration.communication)

---

## üìä METRICS
- APK Size: ~100MB
- Call Connection Time: ~2-5 seconds
- Audio Quality: Good (with proper network)
- Timeout: 45 seconds for unanswered calls
- Max Call Duration: Unlimited

---

## üêõ DEBUGGING
Enable verbose logging:
```dart
print('WebRTC: ${message}');
```

Check Firestore calls collection for state
Monitor console for WebRTC logs
Use Chrome://webrtc-internals for debugging
