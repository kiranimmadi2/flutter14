## CRITICAL: Deploy These Changes to Fix Data Storage

Your app was not storing data because of missing Firebase security rules and indexes. These have now been fixed in the code, but you MUST deploy them to Firebase.

## Step 1: Deploy Security Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Step 2: Deploy Indexes
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

## Step 3: Verify in Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Confirm you see rules for `user_intents`, `intents`, and `ai_posts`
3. Go to Indexes tab and verify composite indexes are created

## Step 4: Test the App
1. Enter a query like "Selling iPhone 15"
2. Check that it appears in History with proper role
3. Verify data appears in Firebase Console → Firestore Database → user_intents collection

## What Was Fixed:
✅ Added missing security rules (was blocking all writes)
✅ Added missing composite indexes (was causing query failures)
✅ Standardized collection names to `user_intents`
✅ Fixed authentication validation
✅ Added comprehensive error logging
✅ Fixed embedding generation issues

## If You See Errors:
Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages with emojis:
- 🚀 Processing starts
- 📝 Intent extraction
- 💾 Firebase storage
- 🔍 Match finding
- ✅ Success steps
- ❌ Error details

Your app should now store and search data properly in Firebase!
